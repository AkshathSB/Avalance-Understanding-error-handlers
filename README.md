# Error-handlers

Learning and understanding how all the error handlers work in solidity.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has three functions that depict the way of all the three error-handlers in solidity. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., Error-Handlers.sol).

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.20" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Aval_mod1_project.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy and input the values asked, by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "error_testing" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling "to_check_require", " to_check_revert", "to_check_assert" functions. Click on the "error_testing" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the ""to_check_require", " to_check_revert", "to_check_assert" functions and enter the required inputs, to know the values of "r" & "q" and uint value in the "to_check_revert" function. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the functions.
